        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>SolveIt is a dedicated initiative focused on addressing some of the most pressing global challenges by implementing practical, community-driven solutions. Starting in Dunaújváros, Hungary, our mission is to inspire local action that contributes to a more sustainable future on a global scale.
		<br></br>
		This website was created as part of a larger project aimed at raising awareness about critical environmental and social issues, including climate change, pollution, deforestation, and resource scarcity. By providing accessible solutions and fostering collaboration, we empower individuals and communities to take meaningful steps toward positive change.
		<br></br>
		At SolveIt, we believe that real impact begins at the local level. Through education, advocacy, and innovative problem-solving, we strive to bridge the gap between awareness and action—ensuring that small, everyday efforts collectively lead to a more sustainable and equitable world.</p>
